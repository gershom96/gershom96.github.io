## Introduction

Offline RL refers to a paradigm in reinforcement learning where the agent learns policies from a fixed dataset collected by a previous policy or from human demonstrations, without interacting with the environment in real-time. This is crucial when interacting with the environment is costly, unsafe, or impractical, such as in healthcare, robotics, or autonomous driving.

## Formal Definition

## Formal Definition

Let \( \mathcal{D} \) represent the offline dataset consisting of transitions \( (s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}) \), where \( s_t \) is the state, \( a_t \) is the action, \( r_t \) is the reward, and \( s_{t+1} \) is the next state. The goal of offline RL is to find a policy \( \pi \) that maximizes the expected return:

$$
J(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t \right]
$$

where \( \gamma \) is the discount factor, and \( \mathcal{D} \) is the only source of information available for learning the policy.

The challenge is dealing with the **distributional shift** due to the policy deviating from the behavior seen in the offline data.

## Key Results

Offline RL methods must handle distributional shift, which occurs when the learned policy selects actions that differ from those in the offline dataset. The main approaches to tackle this issue are:
- **Conservative Policy Learning**: Penalizes deviations from the behavior policy.
- **Model-Based RL**: Uses the dataset to learn a model of the environment and optimizing the policy through model rollouts.
- **Corrected Q-Learning**: Corrects the value estimates to account for the mismatch between actions in the dataset and those chosen by the policy.

## Connection to Decision-Making in Robotics

In robotics, real-world interaction is often expensive and risky. Offline RL enables learning from pre-recorded interactions, such as simulations or demonstrations, making it particularly useful for tasks like robotic manipulation or navigation, where safety and operational costs are a concern. For example, a robot learning to navigate through narrow corridors could use offline RL to avoid costly collisions during training.

## Variants of Offline RL
- **Batch RL**: The traditional setting where the policy must be trained solely on the provided batch of data.
- **Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)**: A method that penalizes Q-values for out-of-distribution actions.
- **Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)**: A variant that avoids estimating out-of-distribution actions by focusing on behavior cloning combined with Q-learning.
- **Behavior Regularized Actor Critic (BRAC)**: Enforces a constraint on the learned policy to stay close to the behavior policy.

## Applications of Offline RL

Offline RL is widely used in:
- **Robotics**: Training robots on offline data to prevent costly real-world trial and error.
- **Healthcare**: Learning treatment strategies from historical patient data.
- **Autonomous Driving**: Learning safe policies from driving data.

## Open Research Questions

Challenges in Offline RL include:
1. **Generalization**: Ensuring the policy performs well in unseen scenarios.
2. **Dataset Bias**: Mitigating biases present in offline data.
3. **Exploration-Exploitation**: Balancing effective policy learning without further exploration.
