I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I work as a research assistant in the [GAMMA lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) under  [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha). 

My research focuses on methods for motion planning and perception for legged and wheeled robots. I have hands-on experience in developing autonomous navigation algorithms and implementing them on robot platforms such as the Ghost Vision 60. Additionally, I am proficient in using ROS and ROS2 for robot development and integration.

Before joining UMD, I worked at [WSO2](https://wso2.com/) as a software engineer on the Identity and Access Management team, contributing to the development of the [Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-server/) and [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/), WSO2's CIAM solution. This role provided me with valuable experience in the software industry and insights into large-scale enterprise solutions. 

I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at [Zone24x7](https://zone24x7.com/), where I was involved in embedded systems development and integrating AI solutions into embedded platforms.

I am proficient in Python, Java, and C++, and I have recently embarked on my academic journey with several submissions to top robotics and AI conferences.
