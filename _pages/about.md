I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I work as a research assistant in the [GAMMA lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) under  [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha). 

My research focuses on methods for motion planning and perception for robots in constrained environments. I have hands-on experience in developing autonomous navigation algorithms and implementing them on robot platforms such as the Ghost Vision 60. Additionally, I am proficient in using ROS and ROS2 for robot development and integration.
